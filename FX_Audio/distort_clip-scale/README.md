Clip Scale Distortion
=====================

Simulates the distortion that results from audio clipping.

Parameters
----------

### Clip at

Sets the volume at which clipping should occur

### Max Volume

Sets the maximum output volume

### Scale Type (Plus/Times)

Sets the type of scaling to use. This is a continuum and will result in a mix of the two types if a value other than 0 or 1 is chosen.

**Plus:** Sets a minimum amplitude and boosts the audio by that amount.
**Times:** Divides all audio by the clipping threshold.
